### Smart Grid Data in the Global Space 

#### Abstract
The United States, along with many other countries, has begun the process of distributing electric power using a “smart” or “intelligent” grid, an infrastructure that uses and analyzes real-time bi-directional data to adjust electric power transmission and delivery (Gellings 1,  Makansi 80-81). From the individual consumer perspective, this involves the installation of “smart meters” in the home, which are IP addressable, internet connected devices, the “smartest” of which send real-time data concerning energy usage to and from energy service providers. While there have been many studies examining the privacy implications of consumers using smart meters (Paverd 1),  this paper will focus on the privacy implications of the United States as a body in the greater geopolitical space. Upon the leakage of smart grid and smart meter data, telling information about the U.S. and its citizens is open for any attacker to take advantage of, wreaking financial havoc, planning well-timed terrorist attacks, or honing methodology for accessing and attacking the grid. Furthermore, as this technology is increasingly distributed and updated, the data stored about individual consumers, and by extension the U.S., will become more detailed and revealing. This paper will examine these concerns and summarize recent attempts to secure the privacy of smart grid data, demonstrating the implications of smart grid policies and data in the United States.
